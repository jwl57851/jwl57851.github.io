			<p>The Atlanta United soccer team is an MLS expansion team, they were in 2014 but started playing in the MLS last year for their first season last year.
They are currently owned by Arthor Blank who is also the owner of the Atlanta Falcons. The team played the first half of their season at Bobby Dodd stadium, which is the home of the Georgia Tech football team.
After the Mercedes Stadium was done being made, the team moved there and started playing their games there .</p>

		 <p>As you can see from the table above the Atlanta United team currently has some very impressive stats. They made the playoffs in that inagural 2017 season. They are the first ever expansion team to do this. The team having such great success in their opening season has done wonders for the club. The fan base has grown ten-fold and they have already broken the record for most people ever at a MLS game(71,874 people!). This being said, this has not only helped the club but the city as well, due to this surprising large interest in soccer from an American city has cause the MLS allstar game to be held in Atlanta as well as it being the top contender as the host city for the 2022 world cup.</p>

<p>As you can see we had a not too good start, but now we are starting to pick up the slack and play better. We have not loss a game since playing Houston. You can also see from the table that the leading scorers from the start of this season are very similar than last season.</p>
